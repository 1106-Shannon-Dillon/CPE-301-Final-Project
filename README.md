# CPE-301-Final-Project

Group Name: Team Awesome
Collaborators: Dillon Shannon, Momo Alverson

PLEASE READ - 
Our coding was done a bit unorthodox, so member contribution cannot be determined through commits. Our code was done on a single computer, and we each implemented different parts i.e. one person would be implementing one part of the physical build i.e. the LCD, while other would be implementing code for a different component, i.e. the water sensor. We would then trade places, and then test and trouble shoot. The comments in the .ino show who contributed what.
